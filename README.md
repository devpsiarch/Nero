# Nero: Neural network framework written from scratch in C!!
## NERO 
Nero is a neural network framework written from scratch in pure C i with help GREAT from mister @Tsoding on Youtube !!!
## test on MNIST dataset
tried running it ... am pretty sure it works however my machine is soo bad so in the matter of 5 min i got this

i guess thats progress ? am sure a good machines from your end and more ompimizations from mine will speed this up.
## Goal ?
The goal from this framework is to understand how neural network and AI work by writting your an implimentation from scratch and tinker around trying to wrape your mind around how big frameworks are made , so that when you are using them you get an deeper understanding of how they work under the hood ... and also its very cool to brag about writting your machine learing models in C.
## Using ?  
- Everyone has C installed right ?
- There is no proper documentation or comments yet , but the functions are strainght forward so just look them up idc ...
## Future Goals for Nero ? 
- Getting a Hardware boost (Using GPUs).
- Running a language model on it.
